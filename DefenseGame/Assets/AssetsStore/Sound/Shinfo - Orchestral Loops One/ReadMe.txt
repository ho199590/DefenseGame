This is my first Asset Store submission and I would appreciate feedback and constructive
criticism if you are willing to give it.

Simply use with your favourite Unity3D audio manager, piece together your own arrangement
in your favourite DAW or use the example arrangement provided.

Each section is divided out between ENTER, LOOP and EXIT. ENTER is for the first loop
through for a section of a song. EXIT is for the last loop of a particular part.
LOOP is for when you want to loop a particular sound. This differentiates from ENTER and
EXIT as you can piece together loops from different parts, where ENTER and EXIT are for
the start and beginning. An example arrangement would be;

part_one_ENTER > part_one_LOOP > part_four_LOOP > part_five_LOOP > part_eight_EXIT

If this is successful, I will be producing more asset store loop libraries, with much more
customisation, such as individual instrument loops and more genres. So if you like it,
please be sure to leave a rating. :)

Thank you
